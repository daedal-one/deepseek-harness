# `@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless`

The dsh one-shot bundle. [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) follows [`dsh-base`](../base/README.md) and the shared [`dsh-agent-plane`](../agent-plane/README.md): it supplies the coding persona and tool mode, disables HMR, mounts Code Mode's worker as a core execution capability, and inserts this package's `headless-runner` plugin (config `{task}`, resolved from the injected `headlessStartup` provider). It mounts no Host, HTTP server, Web runtime, or browser plugin.

After the Loader settles, the runner reads the shared [`ctx.agentModels`](../../core/agent-default-model/README.md), resolves the roster default, records that preset in the Session header, and mounts it during the Agent factory's unpublished setup window. It submits the task as an ordinary user message and waits for quiescence. It flushes the Session before folding the owned durable event interval, writes the last non-empty assistant text to stdout, and requests exit through the launcher-provided `ctx.appExit` host hook ([`dsh-cmdline`](../../boot/cmdline/README.md)) (final `turn/end` completed → 0, otherwise 1). A terminal `error` reason also writes its code and message to stderr; successful runs keep stderr empty. The process opens no listening port. The task text is this app's command line: the ordinary `headless-startup` provider ([`src/startup.ts`](src/startup.ts)) injects `ctx.cmdlineArgs` ([`dsh-cmdline`](../../boot/cmdline/README.md)), reads the positional argument of `dsh --profile headless "task"`, prints the app's `--help`, and provides `headlessStartup`; the runner injects that service and reads its task from lazy config. A missing or whitespace-only task is rejected before the runner activates.

## Model Experience

None, as the selected `agentPreset` owns the prompt, tools, skills, delegation, and output guards while the runner adds only the ordinary user task.

#### KV Cache effect

None; the runner adds nothing to the request prefix.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **One submitted task only** — the runner has no interactive follow-up surface; it waits through any work the Agent completes before returning to idle and prints the last non-empty assistant message in that interval.
- **`ctx.appExit` is launcher-owned** — booting the headless profile outside the `dsh` launcher fails loud at activation until the host provides the exit request.
